# JavaScript Language Basics

Welcome to Week 01, Session 02!

In this lesson, we will cover:

## ðŸ“Œ Statements

-   JavaScript programs are made up of **statements**.
-   Statements **end with a semicolon `;`** (optional but recommended).
-   Example:
    ```js
    let message = "Hello, world!";
    console.log(message);
    ```

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Character Set

JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.
Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.
For a closer look, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.

## ðŸ“Œ JavaScript Expressions

-   An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
-   The computation is called an evaluation.
-   For example, 5 _ 10 evaluates to 50:
    5 _ 10
-   Expressions can also contain variable values:
    x \* 10
-   The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
    For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":
    "John" + " " + "Doe"
