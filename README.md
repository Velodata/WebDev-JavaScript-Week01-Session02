# JavaScript Language Basics

Welcome to Week 01, Session 02!

In this lesson, we will cover:

## 📌 JavaScript Statements

-   JavaScript programs are made up of **statements**.
-   Statements **end with a semicolon `;`** (optional but recommended).
-   Example:

    ```js
    let message = "Hello, world!";
    console.log(message);
    ```

-   JavaScript statements are composed of:
    Values, Operators, Expressions, Keywords, and Comments.
-   For Example:
    This next statement tells the browser to write "Hello Dolly." inside an HTML element with id="demo":
    ```js
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Dolly.";
    ```

## 📌 JavaScript Character Set

-   JavaScript uses the Unicode character set.

-   Unicode covers (almost) all the characters, punctuations, and symbols in the world.

-   For a closer look, please study our Complete Unicode Reference.

## 📌 JavaScript Expressions

-   An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators, which computes to a value.
-   The computation is called an evaluation.
-   For example, 5 _ 10 evaluates to 50:
    5 _ 10
-   Expressions can also contain variable values:
    x \* 10
-   The values can be of various types, such as numbers and strings.
    For example, "John" + " " + "Doe", evaluates to "John Doe":
    "John" + " " + "Doe"
